Active And Inactive Goomba Efficiency Improvement Idea
------------------------------------------------------
Instead of having all inactive and active Goombas in the same list, it may be more efficient to split them up into two list.
An active Goomba list, and an inactive Goomba list. This could save a couple O(n) calls each frame due to not needing to iterate over inactive Goombas. This could be done by implementing 
a move(eId, oldTag, newTag) method in EntityManager. This way a entity can be moved from one list to another (move a inactive goomba to an active goomba list).
