A file for optimization ideas. Note, some ideas are good, some are bad.

Split Up Active and Inactive Goombas Into 2 Lists
------------------------------------------------------
Instead of having all inactive and active Goombas in the same list, it may be more efficient to split them up into two list.
An active Goomba list, and an inactive Goomba list. This could save a couple O(n) calls each frame due to not needing to iterate over inactive Goombas. This could be done by implementing 
a move(eId, oldTag, newTag) method in EntityManager. This way a entity can be moved from one list to another (move a inactive goomba to an active goomba list).

Unneeded CD for Unreachable Tiles
---------------------------------
Their are some tiles that mario will never be able to reach. For example, if a tile was surrounded on all sides by a tile,
then mario would never be able to collide with that tile. So, it would not be necessary to have collision detection for these tiles.
Instead of being tiles, they should be decoration, which does not get CD.
